#### Under the openlane_working_dir folder there are two subdirectories 1. openlane 2. pdks

In this workshop we will be using Skywater 130 pdk.

### The pdk subdirectory has sky130A where we will be working on. It also has open_pdks and skywater-pdk subdirectories

under sky130A, there are two files called "libs.ref" and "lib.tech" , each of the files indicates different functionality

> libs.ref file contains process specific files like timing, lef, cell lef. 

> libs.tech file contains specific to the tool.

Here we will be using "sky130_fd_sc_hd" pdk varaiant.

Under lib folder in the sky130_fd_sc_hd pdk variant, there are different process and PVT corners library files shown below

Under lef and techlef folder in the sky130_fd_sc_hd pdk variant, there are technology lef files named as "tlef" shown below

#### Under the openlane_working_dir folder the tool where we will be working on is "openlane"

> #### To invoke the "openlane" tool, we type the command called "docker" in the present working directory which is "/Desktop/work.tools/openlane/-working_dir/openlane" 

 The terminal appears as shown below 
 
 ![Screenshot 2023-05-31 102802](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/732ef461-0321-425b-81ac-4e21e5beec00)
 
 As we invoke the docker, we can check by tpying our present working directory (pwd) is "/openLANE_flow". 
 
>  The openLANE_flow has the scripts and design folders which we can work on. Using the script is how the flow has to go, here we have the "flow.tcl" and we     use "interactive" mode.

> We use interactive mode that makes the flow from "RTL to GDSII" in step by step manner which is automated by openLANE tool rather than runnng the flow at once.   It helps us understand what is going in each step , which step is doing what and comparing the results.

To run the flow , we require some of the packages. To import the packages we do as shown below

![Screenshot 2023-05-31 104831](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/dc81078d-f5ee-448e-a993-77d462b9da9f)

Now we head back to the design folder which we are going to run. There are multiple designs under the design folder that are already builtin in the openlane. In this workshop we are going to run the design name called "picorv32a" which is run by the openlane tool.

Under the "picorv32a" design folder we can see the "src" , "sky130A_sky130_fd_sc_hd_config.tcl" and "config.tcl" files.
> src file is where the RTL and sdc are present.
> config.tcl bypasses any configurations that has been done in openlane.

![Screenshot 2023-05-31 113229](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/41e82b3b-a41e-418e-bc99-dc495749190f)


Inside the config.tcl file we can see as below. In the design environment there are design required SDC, RTL files and clock period is given as 20ns which is specific to the design and clock nets and setting of the file name which means if the file exisits, source that particular file.

![Screenshot 2023-05-31 111141](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/d72a94fa-9a99-4515-ba3a-e27f990750d5)

When we open "sky130A_sky130_fd_sc_hd_config.tcl" file , we can see the clock period is set as 12ns which overrides the clock period in the "config.tcl" file since sky130A_sky130_fd_sc_hd_config.tcl has highest priority here.
 
#### We have to perform the first step synthesis now , before doing that we need to prepare the file system i.e., to set up the design.

### Design Setup Stage

We need to setup the file system specific to the flow , each and every step of the flow will be fetching files from particular location. Thst location needs to be created. For that we type the below command.

![Screenshot 2023-05-31 113554](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/8d19abee-fe5c-46e1-a819-5e7462c895b7)

> After creating the location for the design, we can see a new directory called "runs" is created under picorv32a design folder.

![Screenshot 2023-05-31 114430](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/b35cc51a-678b-496e-9c2c-09b28b169c6d)

In the run diectory , under the date folder, "tmp" directory is present which is a temporary directory that stores temporary files inside it. The "merged.lef" file is under "tmp" directory.  

![Screenshot 2023-05-31 115212](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/06e911c3-a239-410e-b731-bbbbd51d8ea1)

The merged.lef directory contains cell and tech lef files inside it as shown below.

> The results and reports are under the date directory which contains the folders for each step of the design.

> The config.tcl files are under the "picorv32a" directory and "runs" directory are shown below.

### Run Synthesis
> The command to run in the openlane prompt is "run_synthesis". This will run the yosys and abc synthesis 

After we ran the synthesis, it appears as shown below

> When we look at the sysnthesis flow, we can see the statistics of the design 

![Screenshot 2023-05-31 125002](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/0b5b92f1-6537-455d-a621-53e6d623b11e)

#### Checking the Synthesised Netlist

> We can check the synthesised netlist "picor32a.synthesis.v" in the results folder where the mapping is done. The abc has done all the mapping.

#### Checking the Timing Reports

##### The timing reports generated after running the synthesis are shown below

Some of the reports are shown below
