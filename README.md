### Simplified RTL2GDS flow

The RTL-to-GDS (Register Transfer Level to Graphic Data System) flow is the process of transforming a digital design described at the RTL level into a physical layout ready for fabrication. Here is a simplified overview of the RTL-to-GDS flow:

1. RTL Design:
The flow begins with the creation of the RTL design using a hardware description language (HDL) like Verilog or VHDL. The RTL design describes the behavior and interconnections of the digital circuit.

2. RTL Synthesis:
The RTL design is synthesized using an RTL synthesis tool, such as Yosys. RTL synthesis transforms the high-level RTL description into a gate-level netlist, which represents the design in terms of logic gates and flip-flops.

3. Technology Mapping:
The gate-level netlist is then mapped to a target technology library. During this step, the logic gates in the netlist are replaced with specific cells from the library that match the desired functionality. The technology library contains standard cells that are optimized for the target process technology.

4. Floorplanning:
Floorplanning involves determining the placement of different functional blocks within the chip's layout. It considers factors such as block sizes, power and clock distribution, and I/O placement. Floorplanning helps create an initial estimate of the chip's area and determines the overall chip dimensions.

5. Placement:
Placement refers to the process of determining the specific locations of individual gates and components on the chip. It aims to minimize the chip's area and optimize the interconnect lengths for better performance. Placement tools, like OpenROAD, are used to achieve an efficient and optimized placement.

6. Clock Tree Synthesis:
Clock tree synthesis (CTS) is the construction of a clock distribution network that delivers clock signals to different parts of the chip. The goal is to ensure balanced and low-skew clock distribution, minimizing clock delay and skew among flip-flops. CTS tools generate the clock tree structure and insert buffer and repeater cells to achieve proper clock distribution.

7. Routing:
Routing involves establishing the physical connections between the components and interconnecting the nets based on the placement results. The router takes into account the design rules and constraints to create a routing solution that satisfies timing and electrical requirements. The routing process may involve multiple layers of metal interconnects.

8. Design Rule Checking:
After routing, the layout is checked against the design rules provided by the foundry. Design Rule Checking (DRC) ensures that the layout adheres to specific constraints related to minimum spacing, width, and other manufacturing requirements. DRC tools identify and report violations that need to be fixed.

9. Layout vs. Schematic (LVS) Checking:
Layout vs. Schematic (LVS) verification compares the connectivity and functionality of the layout with the original schematic representation. It ensures that the physical layout matches the intended design and that there are no errors or discrepancies.

10. Timing Analysis:
Timing analysis is performed to ensure that the design meets the required timing constraints. Tools like OpenSTA are used to analyze the timing paths and identify any violations such as setup time, hold time, or maximum delay violations.

11. GDS Generation:
Once the design has passed all verification steps, the final step is to generate the GDSII (Graphic Data System version II) file. The GDSII file contains the layout information in a standardized format that can be used for mask generation and fabrication.

It's important to note that the actual RTL-to-GDS flow can be more complex, involving additional steps and optimizations. The above overview provides a simplified understanding of the key stages involved in transforming an RTL design into a physical layout ready for manufacturing.

#### Under the openlane_working_dir folder there are two subdirectories 1. openlane 2. pdks

In this workshop we will be using Skywater 130 pdk.

### The pdk subdirectory has sky130A where we will be working on. It also has open_pdks and skywater-pdk subdirectories

under sky130A, there are two files called "libs.ref" and "lib.tech" , each of the files indicates different functionality

> libs.ref file contains process specific files like timing, lef, cell lef. 

> libs.tech file contains specific to the tool.

Here we will be using "sky130_fd_sc_hd" pdk varaiant.

![Screenshot 2023-05-31 082233](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/ee6b21f0-fad7-4b7b-b2a8-b2ef25474ce0)

Under lib folder in the sky130_fd_sc_hd pdk variant, there are different process and PVT corners library files shown below

![Screenshot 2023-05-31 092919](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/108c050b-4fb9-4b28-99d5-188a287e4418)

Under lef and techlef folder in the sky130_fd_sc_hd pdk variant, there are technology lef files named as "tlef" shown below

![Screenshot 2023-05-31 100821](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/916758b8-a099-4410-a527-baba36198de8)

#### Under the openlane_working_dir folder the tool where we will be working on is "openlane"

> #### To invoke the "openlane" tool, we type the command called "docker" in the present working directory which is "/Desktop/work.tools/openlane/-working_dir/openlane" 

 The terminal appears as shown below 
 
 ![Screenshot 2023-05-31 102802](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/732ef461-0321-425b-81ac-4e21e5beec00)
 
 As we invoke the docker, we can check by tpying our present working directory (pwd) is "/openLANE_flow". 
 
>  The openLANE_flow has the scripts and design folders which we can work on. Using the script is how the flow has to go, here we have the "flow.tcl" and we     use "interactive" mode.

> We use interactive mode that makes the flow from "RTL to GDSII" in step by step manner which is automated by openLANE tool rather than runnng the flow at once.   It helps us understand what is going in each step , which step is doing what and comparing the results.

![Screenshot 2023-05-31 104540](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/5b8566c2-73e7-4186-be08-0b291a0560cb)

To run the flow , we require some of the packages. To import the packages we do as shown below

![Screenshot 2023-05-31 104831](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/dc81078d-f5ee-448e-a993-77d462b9da9f)

Now we head back to the design folder which we are going to run. There are multiple designs under the design folder that are already builtin in the openlane. In this workshop we are going to run the design name called "picorv32a" which is run by the openlane tool.

Under the "picorv32a" design folder we can see the "src" , "sky130A_sky130_fd_sc_hd_config.tcl" and "config.tcl" files.
> src file is where the RTL and sdc are present.
> config.tcl bypasses any configurations that has been done in openlane.

![Screenshot 2023-05-31 113229](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/41e82b3b-a41e-418e-bc99-dc495749190f)


Inside the config.tcl file we can see as below. In the design environment there are design required SDC, RTL files and clock period is given as 20ns which is specific to the design and clock nets and setting of the file name which means if the file exisits, source that particular file.

![Screenshot 2023-05-31 111141](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/d72a94fa-9a99-4515-ba3a-e27f990750d5)

When we open "sky130A_sky130_fd_sc_hd_config.tcl" file , we can see the clock period is set as 12ns which overrides the clock period in the "config.tcl" file since sky130A_sky130_fd_sc_hd_config.tcl has highest priority here.
 
#### We have to perform the first step synthesis now , before doing that we need to prepare the file system i.e., to set up the design.

### Design Setup Stage

We need to setup the file system specific to the flow , each and every step of the flow will be fetching files from particular location. Thst location needs to be created. For that we type the below command.

  Theory
 
 ###  Foorplaning  considerations



### Part 2: Lab2 -Steps to run floorplan using OpenLANE
> openlane directory , we can go to configuration folder where we can see for the .tcl files for floorplan, placement and cts stages as well as README.md file where we can check for the variables of all these stages that are required.

#### Where are the switches set?

> The "set" values for the variables in each stages are the system default values in the specific .tcl file. Below shown is the floorplan.tcl file.

![Screenshot 2023-06-01 095358](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/a3dea347-7eeb-4c58-a1a7-5f91209643ec)

#### Precedence of .tcl files

> Here the lowest prioroty is the system default i.e., the "floorplan.tcl" file settings , after that "config.tcl" and the next is "sky130A_sky130_fd_sc_hd_config.tcl"

### Running the floorplan with the system default values

> After running the "run_floorplan" folder in the openlane prompt window , we can check the reports, results and log files under "runs" folder as shown below.

  ### Placement Stages
   > Global Placment    - Coarse placement without legalization and in openlane the main criteria for global placement stage is reducing the wirelength also called as half paramenter wire length (HPWL).
   
   > Detailed Placement - legalization happens in the detailed placement i.e., standard cells are placed in  standard cell rows , without overlapping with each   other.
   
   > Here I am doing the condition related placement not concentrating on the timing , to ensure the congestion is less.

   #### Placement is completed by running the command "run_placement" in the openlane prompt terminal
   
    run_placement

#### Lab steps to create standard cell layout and extract spice netlist

#### Creation of a standard cell in magic layout

To create a bounding box in Magic with the specified dimensions, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Magic tool and invoke the sky130 technology file by running the command:

   magic -T sky130A.tech
 

2. In the Magic tkcon window, type the following command to create the bounding box:
  
   property FIXED_BBOX {0 0 138 272}

   This command sets the fixed bounding box with the given dimensions. The values {0 0} represent the bottom-left coordinates of the bounding box, and the values {138 272} represent the top-right coordinates. The width of the bounding box is set to 138, which is 3 times the width of the standard cell (0.46 * 3 = 1.38). The height is set to the height of the standard cell, which is 272.

3. After entering the command, press Enter. The bounding box will be created with the specified dimensions.

Now you have successfully created a bounding box in Magic with a width of 1.38 (3 times the width of the standard cell) and a height of 2.72 (height of the standard cell). You can proceed with your layout design within this bounding box.

![image](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/965a173c-ab8e-482f-97bd-08e41bef1453)

To proceed with defining the ground and power segments, contacts, and the layout of the logic part in the standard cell layout design using Magic, you can follow these steps:

1. Define Ground and Power Segments:

   - In the Magic tkcon window, select the metal layer 1 (M1) for defining the ground and power segments. Use the command:
     
     layer M1
     

   - To define the ground segment, draw a rectangle by specifying its coordinates using the `box` command. For example:
     
     box 0 0 138 20
     
     This command creates a rectangle from coordinates (0, 0) to (138, 20) on the M1 layer, representing the ground segment.

   - Similarly, define the power segment using the `box` command. For example:
     
     box 0 252 138 272
     
     This command creates a rectangle from coordinates (0, 252) to (138, 272) on the M1 layer, representing the power segment.

2. Define Contacts:

   - Switch to the contact layer (typically via M1 stack) using the command:
    
     layer contact
    
   - To define a contact for the ground segment, use the `box` command to draw a rectangle at the appropriate location. For example:
    
     box 130 0 138 8
    
     This command creates a contact rectangle from coordinates (130, 0) to (138, 8) on the contact layer, representing the contact for the ground segment.

   - Similarly, define a contact for the power segment using the `box` command. For example:
     
     box 130 264 138 272
     
     This command creates a contact rectangle from coordinates (130, 264) to (138, 272) on the contact layer, representing the contact for the power segment.

3. Layout of the Logic Part:

   - Switch to the desired layer for drawing the logic part layout (typically M1) using the command:
   
     layer <desired_layer>

   - Now, you can draw the layout of the logic part of the standard cell using various commands, such as `rect`, `poly`, and `wire`. These commands allow you to define shapes, polygons, and wires respectively, based on the desired circuit design.

   - Specify the coordinates and dimensions of the logic part components using the appropriate commands. For example:

     rect 20 30 40 60
 
     This command creates a rectangle at coordinates (20, 30) with a width of 40 and height of 60 on the specified layer.

   - Continue defining the layout of the logic part as per your circuit design requirements, using the relevant commands to create shapes, polygons, and wires.

By following these steps, you can define the ground and power segments, contacts, and layout of the logic part for any standard cell layout in Magic. Remember to switch between the appropriate layers using the `layer` command based on the element you want to define or draw.

> We can check and modify the drc errors in the magic window by clicking on 'DRC' menu and select 'DRC find next error'

#### How to extract the inverter layout in ngspice

> Step 1: To create ngspice file

To extract the inverter in ngspice, all we need to do is write the 'extract all' in tkcon.tcl window and we can see the ext file and check in the 'vsdstdcelldesign' directory.

![image](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/e92f60dc-2ff5-4a1e-9666-ac5176f46f46)

> Step 2: To extract spice file inside the vsdstdcelldesign directory we should give the following command

![Screenshot 2023-06-02 144947](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/f0d1b5b1-f7ec-4432-b572-0f1456a3343c)

 When we open the spice file it has as shown below

![image](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/c771adf7-ac1e-4419-8ee5-d28c2c49922f)

#### Lab steps to create final SPICE deck using SKY130 tech

 When you open the spice file which is extracted and modify the file by giving inputs as pshort , nshort library model files , source, ground and setting the grid values with trainsient analysis we have seen in the magic window before running it in the ngspice file. The modified file is shown below.

![image](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/d518fbf4-9b92-4de5-81f4-5ccb6f1bb0d6)

> The model file looks like this. The below shown is the 'pshort.lib' model file

![Screenshot 2023-06-03 105635](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/380d6a91-6ff6-4cf0-a7a0-7e409dbd3fc7)

> After running the ngspice with the spice file, we get the output like this

![Screenshot 2023-06-03 105518](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/023f36d1-b8af-4c74-b111-60a264dc0dd6)

#### Lab steps to chracterize inverter using SKY130 model files

> To check the plot we need to type "plot y vs time a". Here y is the output, time is the time period and a is the input.

![image](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/3ffd5f75-ffaa-4e1f-8e50-ba4b80956c80)

Here the spikes are showing on the plotted pulse, to overcome that we need to change the Cload in the "sky130_inv.spice"as higher value than the previos one, I changed to 2fF. Now the plot like below, some what better compared to the previous one.

![image](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/eb625570-bdb0-4784-a6e4-fd6aedb036e1)

Next step is to charcetize the cell that means to find the value of four parameters 1. Rise Transition (output rise 20%-80%) 2. Fall Transition(output fall 80%-20%) 3.Fall cell delay 4.Rise cell delay also called the propogation delay. 

> For Rise Transition, the 20% of 3.3V is 0.64

![image](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/cabbc52e-8163-4316-8148-441e07a26674)

![Screenshot 2023-06-03 112037](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/f18639fe-36cc-4b2e-9947-878be2d4f717)


> For Rise Transition, the 80% of 3.3V is 2.64

![Screenshot 2023-06-03 112351](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/fea67921-7c89-49e2-ab9e-1a5d3b695815)

![Screenshot 2023-06-03 112330](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/dc2f1d06-7071-4c29-8152-8585b2dadb8a)

Therefore the Rise transition for the above plot is 2.245-2.181 = 0.064ns

> Similarly for fall transition , from 80%-20%

For 80%, the fall transition is

![Screenshot 2023-06-03 113523](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/77d90d33-60cd-4b4c-b151-7129d1bba9d2)

For 20%, the fall transition is

![Screenshot 2023-06-03 113626](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/bf1b71a3-be68-4863-b7d0-7c21964ec9b8)

Therefore the Fall transition for the above plot is 0.04ns

> Cell rise delay at 50% of 3.3V is 1.64V , therefore the output and input at 50% is shown below

![Screenshot 2023-06-03 114304](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/4ef01af6-1694-4f27-9f0b-0c569dbdf11a)

Therefore 2.2132-2.1498 = 0.0634ns is the cell rise delay.

> Cell fall delay at 50% of 3.3V is 1.64V , therefore the output and input at 50% is shown below

![image](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/aa779c09-83aa-4c93-a0c1-021d9bd2e339)

Therefore 4.09-4.07 = 0.02ns is the cell fall delay.

> Next objective is to use the inverter layout to create a  LEF file and this LEF file will be used in the openlane and plug-in this cell by making a custom cell uing a custom link. We will plug this cell in picorv32 core and see the openlane takes this input or not.

![image](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/ec920ae6-35a1-4d34-b625-095f95c803b7)

or from the magic window "menu - file - open -load file9here, metal3.mag".

![image](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/50feb95c-eb8c-4021-87cc-72e57eea0d9b)

We can look for the rules from https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/ for each of them. Here for metal 3 the rules can be seen as below from the link.

> Under the 'Design rules' content go to 'periphery rules', from there we can click on metal 3 rule button and you can see like this below

![image](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/2ec55e57-62ba-4066-b421-9fb03b3e6a43)

> To look on the area of the metal 3 opened in the magic window , click 'left mouse button' and then 'right mouse button' drag the box by clicking right mouse button and then click 'column (: or ;)' and type 'drc why'.

![image](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/8900b3c1-27d5-4ad5-b2d3-64e50c10d46f)

1. Start by hovering your mouse pointer over the M3 contact icon on the side toolbar. This will allow you to draw a large area of M3 contact on the layout.

2. Once you have drawn the M3 contact area, a cursor box will appear around it.

3. Now, type the command "cif see VIA2" to create contact cuts represented as black square shapes. These contact cuts don't physically exist on the drawn layout but are used as a mask layer called VIA2, which will be included in the GDS (Graphic Data System) file.

4. Additional details about these contact cuts can be found in the CIF output section of the tech file.

5. The current view is the feedback entry. You can dismiss it by using the command "feed clear".

6. To ensure accurate placement, use the internal snap command "snap int" for the cursor to move along the edge of the grid.

7. There are specific spacing rules to follow. For example, the spacing between VIA2 and Metal 3 should be 0.065u.

8. To measure the distance, position the cursor between the contact cut and the drawn via edge, then click the box in the "tkcon" command. This will provide the distance between them.

9. The tool will automatically handle the placement and spacing of the contact cuts, ensuring there are no Design Rule Check (DRC) errors, and the distance will not be smaller than the specified value.

### Lab : To fix poly.9 error in sky130 tech-file

Steps to fil poly.9 error in sky130 tech-file

1. Start by loading the "poly.mag" file in the tkcon window. You can do this using the command "load poly.mag".

2. Use the mouse cursor to locate the area where the error is occurring. In this case, it is the violation of "Poly.9" due to spacing between "polyres" and "poly" layers.

3. Open the technology file, "sky130A.tech", and search for any existing design rule check (DRC) rules related to "Poly.9". Determine if a rule for the spacing between "polyres" and "poly" layers already exists.

![image](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/e12e6fff-209a-4d98-9275-bea2dfe66e76)

4. If there is no existing rule for the spacing between "polyres" and "poly", create a new rule in the technology file. Define the required spacing between these layers. This rule will ensure proper spacing for all instances of "polyres" and "poly".

5. Once you have modified the technology file to include the new rule, load the updated file in the tkcon window using the command "tech load sky130A.tech".

6. The design tool might not automatically perform a DRC check after loading the technology file. Therefore, manually initiate a DRC check to verify if the modifications have resolved the spacing violation. Use the command "drc check" to run the DRC check.

7. After the DRC check, you might find that the spacing violation between "polyres" and "poly" has been resolved. However, it is possible that the spacing between "poly" and "tap/diff" layers is now violated.

8. To address this new violation, modify the technology file to include the necessary spacing rule between "poly" and "tap/diff" layers.

![image](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/6f8e41b7-ade2-4ab0-b7a2-4c9d9326c01c)

9. Load the updated technology file again in the tkcon window using the command "tech load sky130A.tech".

![image](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/246e3e57-5911-407b-9ba7-0c7f4bcc320a)

10. Perform another DRC check to ensure that all spacing violations, including the ones between "polyres" and "poly" as well as "poly" and "tap/diff", have been resolved.

![image](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/78ad9691-b01f-426e-94b7-778ae9e9ab0a)

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the spacing violations and ensure that the design meets the required design rules for the "polyres," "poly," and "tap/diff" layers.

### Lab4 Pre-Layout Timing analysis and importance of good clock tree

#### Timing modelling using delay tables

##### Lab steps to convert grid info to track info

> Next objective is to use the inverter layout to create a  LEF file and this LEF file will be used in the openlane and plug-in this cell by making a custom cell uing a custom link. We will plug this cell in picorv32 core and see the openlane takes this input or not.

![image](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/82b46fc7-39de-4ee2-9fcc-d76db3afb3ce)

#### Tracks

The width and height of a standard cell should be odd multiples of the horizontal track pitch and vertical track pitch. This information is specified using the following syntax in the "tracks.info" file:

metallayer direction offset spacing
li1 X 0.23 0.46
li1 Y 0.17 0.34

In the above syntax, "li1" represents the metal layer. The "X" and "Y" denote the direction of the tracks, where "X" refers to the horizontal direction and "Y" refers to the vertical direction.

The "offset" value indicates the starting position of the first track, and the "spacing" value represents the distance between adjacent tracks.

For example, in the "li1 X 0.23 0.46" line, it means that for the metal layer "li1" in the horizontal direction, the offset of the first track is 0.23 units, and the spacing between tracks is 0.46 units.

Similarly, in the "li1 Y 0.17 0.34" line, it means that for the metal layer "li1" in the vertical direction, the offset of the first track is 0.17 units, and the spacing between tracks is 0.34 units.

By adhering to these specifications, the standard cell's width and height will be ensured to be odd multiples of the horizontal and vertical track pitches, respectively.

#### To determine if the I/O ports are located at an intersection, follow these steps on the TKCON window:

Activate the grid by pressing 'G' on the magic console.

Set the grid size to the desired dimensions, such as 0.46um, 0.34um, 0.23um, or 0.17um.

Locate the I/O ports in the LI1 layer.

Check if the I/O ports align at the intersection points on the grid.

#### Lab steps to convert magic layout to std cell layout

### Create Port Definition

Open the Magic Layout window and source the .mag file for the design, such as the inverter.

Navigate to the "Edit" menu and select "Text." This action will open a dialogue box for entering text.

Double press the 'S' key while the cursor is positioned at the I/O labels. This action automatically populates the text with the string name and size information of the port.

> In the figure below, the number specified in the text area adjacent to the enable checkbox determines the sequencing of the ports when they are written in the LEF file. The number assigned to each port represents its order, starting from 0 as the first port in the list.

By following these steps, you can define ports for the macro cell in the Magic console and proceed with the LEF extraction process.

> To determine the connectivity of the ground and power layers from the metal1 layer, follow these steps:

In the Magic window, create a box or rectangle over the areas designated as VPWR (power) and VGND (ground).

Switch to the TKCON window.

Use the appropriate command in the TKCON window to check the connectivity of the ground and power layers from the metal1 layer.

By performing these steps, you can verify the connectivity of the ground and power layers and ensure that they are either the same or different from the signal layer.

> Next step is to plug this lef file into picorv32. Before we do this we need to move the files into "src" folder to present all our design files in one location.

> We have to include our custom cell into the openlane flow. The first step is "Synthesis". For this we need to have a library that has our "cell definition".

For STA analysis we require three libraries where pmos and nmos work in different corners depending on the tepmperature. There are slow(SS), fast(FF) and typical corners(TT). The tool should map the vsd cell during  the synthesis.

> Now we should copy these libs into the src folder under picorv32a design

### Post-synthesis timing analysis Using OpenSTA

Timing analysis using the OpenSTA tool is typically performed outside the openLANE flow. To initiate the STA analysis, you would invoke OpenSTA with the pre_sta.conf configuration file, 

sta pre_sta.conf

During the placement stage of the design flow, the clock is assumed to be ideal, as it is propagated only once Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS) is performed. Therefore, before CTS, only setup slack is considered in the analysis.

Setup time refers to the minimum time required for the data to stabilize before the active edge of the clock so that it can be correctly captured.

Setup slack is calculated as the data required time minus the data arrival time. It represents the available timing margin for the setup time.

The clock is generated from a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL), which consists of built-in circuit elements and logic. Variations can occur in the clock generation process depending on the specific circuit. These variations collectively contribute to clock uncertainty. One such parameter is clock jitter, which refers to the deviation of the clock edge from its original position.

Clock uncertainty encompasses various factors such as skew, jitter, and margin. Skew refers to the variation in arrival times of the clock signal at different points in the circuit. Jitter represents the uncertainty in the arrival time of the clock due to deviations from its expected position. Margin indicates the amount of tolerance or safety margin available in the timing analysis to account for various uncertainties and process variations.

By analyzing the timing report, you can identify areas where slack can be improved. One approach to improving slack is upsizing the cells, which involves replacing them with higher drive strength cells. This modification can lead to significant changes in the slack, ultimately improving the timing performance of the design.

Certainly! Here's a rewritten version of the information you provided:

During the Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS) stage, the goal is to ensure that the clock reaches each clock pin from the clock source with minimum skew and insertion delay. This is achieved by implementing an H-tree structure using a midpoint strategy. Clock inverters or buffers are inserted in the clock path to balance skews.

Before running the CTS in the TritonCTS tool, it's important to check if the slack was attempted to be reduced in a previous run. If so, the netlist may have been modified through cell replacement techniques. Therefore, the Verilog file needs to be updated using the "write_verilog" command. Following that, the synthesis, floorplan, and placement stages are rerun.

### To execute the CTS, the following command is used:

run_cts

![Screenshot 2023-06-06 102915](https://github.com/nikhithatb/vsdiatworkshop/assets/135085619/253e6b9f-8dab-4028-bfa8-ffa6d68f9f03)


After the CTS run, the slack values are obtained. For example:

Setup slack: 4.33
Hold slack: 0.25

Once the clock is propagated through the CTS stage, the subsequent timing analysis is performed with real clocks. This is done within the openlane flow using the OpenROAD tool.

The following commands are used:

openroad

write_db pico_cts.db

read_db pico_cts.db

read_verilog /openLANE_flow/designs/picorv32a/runs/03-07_11-25/results/synthesis/picorv32a.synthesis_cts.v

read_liberty $::env(LIB_SYNTH_COMPLETE)

link_design picorv32a

read_sdc /openLANE_flow/designs/picorv32a/src/my_base.sdc

set_propagated_clock (all_clocks)

report_checks -path_delay min_max -format full_clock_expanded -digits 4


After performing the post-CTS timing analysis, the resulting slack values are obtained. For example:

Setup slack: 4.0565
Hold slack: -0.1673

These slack values provide information about the timing margins in the design, where positive values indicate sufficient margin and negative values indicate violations.
